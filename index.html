        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Sociology Student</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a student at UCR. I am studying Sociology and Administrative Studies. So far, I have done most of my classes online
        as im a commuting student who travels about two hours if for some reason I need to get to campus. In my fututre, with my degree, I am hoping to pursue a 
        career in social work or counseling. I'm very passionate about helping others and am a strong advocate for reaching out 
        and recieving mental help. As someone whos been negatively affected by the effects of mental health, wether personally or through those around me,
        my goal through school is to help relieve others of that pain. There can never be too many people in the mental health industry. I just want to be one more
        person there to help.
        <br><br>

        Aside from mental health advocacy, I am also very passionate about music. More specifically, singing. I have been singing ever since I was young and 
        it has been a dream of mine to become a famous singer one day. On multiple ocassions throughout high school, I was gie=ven the opportunity
        to perform the national anthem in front of my school during pep rallies and most notably during my graduation ceremony. I also joined the drama club
        in order to participate in their productions. Though actimng was not necessarily my forte, I stuck with the club in order to be able to sing more 
        when came time to put on musicals. Realistcally speaking, I will continue through school to continue pursuing my degree however if given the chance,
         I would want nothing more than to perform again in the future. Since music has also been an incredible part of my life, it would be silly to let it go now.<br><br>

        And finally, my home life. I currently live alone and work aside from school in order to support myself. Luckily financial aid has been an amazing privellege I have 
        been given. I have two cats who I love dearly and who I could not possibly part with. I live close to practically my entire family which is always
        really fun as I get to see them very often. I spend most of my time either doing school work or working at my job but in my free time I enjoy singing, 
        drawing, and listening to music. I have recemtly started working on a new sketchbook seeing as I completely filled my last one, and from time to time,
        I will record songs in my room just to have for mysel fto track my vocal improvement. I also spend free time with friends as much as I can but nights
        are unfortunately reserved to spend with my cats.
